Twitter account recon
A little script (probably very poorly written!) to go to the Twitter API
and grab some key data from a target account's most recent 200 tweets.
Output is:

% of original tweets
% of tweets which are retweets
Average number of retweets of target content
Highest retweet value
Lowest retweet value

Currently it can only accept one target at the commandline, i.e.:

pything twitter_user_recce.py bbcbreaking

You need to edit the script to add your own Twitter API keys.
